Description="Sonic 06 Ultimate... just kidding.\n\nMainly a mod that changes the lighting of a bunch of stages. Most of the bosses and levels have 'redone' lighting, with some characters even having their own lighting for a stage. Cutscene lighting has been left unchanged, I'm too lazy to keep them updated.\n\nThere's some small texture edits and added stage terrain in a couple stages (Radical Train and Kingdom Valley as of now). The iron crates have a new model as well. Lastly, the water in Wave Ocean now has planar reflections.\n\nSome music tracks have also been swapped around so the song names better describes the location (Whirlwind/Tornado and Lakeside/The Castle).\n\nv5.0"

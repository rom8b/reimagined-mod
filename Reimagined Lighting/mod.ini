Description="Sonic 06 Ultimate... just kidding.\n\n!! THE MAIN MOD IS NOT SUPPORTED WITH CUSTOM STAGES !!\n\nThis is mainly a mod that changes the lighting of a bunch of stages. Most of the boss stages and levels have 'redone' lighting, with some characters even having their own lighting for a stage.\n\nSome stages have had their collision updated. Currently, only Kingdom Valley, Flame Core, Wave Ocean, and Dusty Desert Section A have had their collision updated. They were the only stages that really bugged me. All of the loops and caves will drop you if you're not moving (some precautions have also been made to prevent you from falling out of bounds). Certain places also no longer collide with the camera.\n\nSome stages have a couple extra details, mainly to fill the empty space outside of stages. Real time reflections have also been added and adjusted on some stages. They should no longer freeze when entering the water.\n\nSome music tracks have also been swapped around so the song names better describes the location (Sonic's Whirlwind/Tornado and Sonic's Lakeside/The Castle). The main menu and battle menu music has been changed as well.\n\nAdd-ons:\n\nThe first add-on is a character script edit. There's a ton of minor changes, but to sum up the most important changes: characters have higher base speed, the light dash range has been fixed to also target rings below you, Tails' flying has been changed to be more similar to the classics, and many moves and attacks have been altered to be more useful.\n\nAnd to make it truly Sonic '06 Ultimate, there's one last add-on to have gold or silver cosmetics (for playable characters).\n\nv6.0"

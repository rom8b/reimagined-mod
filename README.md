# Reimagined Lighting
Files for a meh Sonic 06 mod. It's a mainly a lighting mod, but there are some model changes and additions. And yes, I'm aware the thumbnail isn't evenly spaced.

How to install:
Take the mods and place it inside your Sonic 06 mod folder. Save, install content, then launch 06

The version on GitHub is more of a "dev" build, some stuff might be broken or some stuff might be removed or changed. Performance may also be really bad. The wiki tab will be some documentation for export settings (Blender) and other miscellaneous things like scene parameter notes. As I use Xenia, I cant guarantee it will work on real hardware.

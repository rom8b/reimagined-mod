# reimagined-mod
files for a meh sonic 06 mod. it's a lighting mod, but there are some model changes and additions. yes im aware the thumbnail isn't evenly spaced

how to install:
take the "Reimagined Lighting" folder outside of the "reimagined-mod-main" folder, and place it inside your sonic 06 mod folder. save, install content, then launch 06

the version on github is more of a "dev" build, some stuff might be broken or some stuff might be removed or changed. the wiki tab will be some documentation for export settings (blender) and other miscellaneous things like scene parameter notes. as i use xenia, i cant guarantee it will work on real hardware.
